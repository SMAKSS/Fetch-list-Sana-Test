# sanaTest
Here's an interview test for Sana.
This project for simplicity runs on **laravel 5.7** so if you want to test it you have to got this version or higher.
The target of the project is to communicating with apis with post and get request, with using register form and list of addresses.

Project ran on English language totally, in this project for simplicity we use **Bulma css framework**, **Leaflet** map integration, and also **Fontawesome** for using Leaflet we also needed to use jQuery as well.
We could use some JS framework like Vue.JS or libraries like React, but since the scale of project was to tiny we did not import any of them!  

**Requirement:**
`Composer, Laravel 5.7.*, Guzzle, Apache, Including Cacert.perm if you are using LocalHost`

**Screen Shots:**
We provide some screenshots for better understanding the concept of project and it's usability.
